        <h1>Paolo Maldini</h1>

        <p><b>Paolo Cesare Maldini</b> OMRI (Italian pronunciation: [&rsquo;pa&colon;olo mal&rsquo;di&colon;ni]; born <time datetime="1968-06-26">June 26,1968</time>) is an Italian former professional footballer who played primarily as a left-back and centre-back for AC Milan and the Italy national team. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest defenders of all time. As the Milan and Italy captain for many years he was nicknamed "Il Capitano". Maldini held the record for most appearances in Serie A, with 647 (until <time datetime="2020">2020</time>, when he was overtaken by Gianluigi Buffon) and holds the joint-record for most European Cup/UEFA Champions League final appearances (8) alongside Paco Gento. He most recently served as technical director for Milan, as well as being co-owner of USL Championship club Miami FC.</p>

        <p>Maldini spent all 25 seasons of his playing career in the Serie A with Milan, before retiring at the age of 41 in <time datetime="2009">2009</time>. He won 26 trophies with Milan: the European Cup/UEFA Champions League five times, seven Serie A titles, one Coppa Italia, five Supercoppa Italiana titles, five European/UEFA Super Cups, two Intercontinental Cups and one FIFA Club World Cup. Maldini won the Best Defender trophy at the UEFA Club Football Awards at the age of 39, as well as the Serie A Defender of the Year Award in <time datetime="2004">2004</time>. Following his retirement after the <time datetime="2008">2008</time>&ndash;<time datetime="2009">2009</time> season, Milan retired his number 3 shirt.</p>

        <p>Maldini made his debut for Italy in <time datetime="1988">1988</time>, playing for 14 years before retiring in <time datetime="2002">2002</time> with 7 goals and 126 caps, an appearance record at the time, which has since been surpassed by Fabio Cannavaro and Gianluigi Buffon. Maldini captained Italy for eight years and held the record for appearances as Italy's captain (75), until he was again overtaken by Cannavaro and Buffon. With Italy, Maldini took part in four FIFA World Cups and three UEFA European Championships. Although he did not win a tournament with Italy, he reached the final of the <time datetime="1994">1994</time> World Cup and Euro <time datetime="2000">2000</time>, and the semi-final of the <time datetime="1990">1990</time> World Cup and Euro <time datetime="1988">1988</time>. He was elected into the all-star teams for each of these tournaments, in addition to Euro <time datetime="1996">1996</time>.</p>

        <p>Maldini came second to George Weah for FIFA World Player of the Year in <time datetime="1995">1995</time>. He also placed third in the Ballon d'Or in <time datetime="1994">1994</time> and <time datetime="2003">2003</time>. In <time datetime="2002">2002</time>, he was chosen as a defender on the FIFA World Cup Dream Team, and in <time datetime="2004">2004</time> Pelé named him in the FIFA 100 list of the world's greatest living players. He was ranked 21st in World Soccer magazine's list of the 100 greatest players of the 20th century. He was also selected for the Ballon d'Or Dream Team in <time datetime="2020">2020</time>. Maldini held the record for most appearances in UEFA Club competitions, with 174, until he was overtaken by Iker Casillas in <time datetime="2017">2017</time>. He is the record appearance holder for Milan with 902 appearances in all competitions, and is one of the few players to have made over 1,000 career appearances. In <time datetime="2012-12">December 2012</time>, he was inducted into the Italian Football Hall of Fame.</p>

            <h3><b><time datetime="1984">1984</time>&ndash;<time datetime="1987">1987</time>: Youth career, AC Milan senior debut and early professional career</b></h3>

            <p>Originally a AC Milan youth squad product, Maldini also went on to play his entire club career with the senior side. He won the Coppa Italia Primavera with the Milan Youth side during the <time datetime="1984">1984</time>&ndash;<time datetime="1985">1985</time> season, and he made his league debut for Milan under manager Nils Liedholm during the same season on <time datetime="1985-01-20">20 January,1985</time>, replacing the injured Sergio Battistini in a match against Udinese at age 16. It was his only league appearance of the campaign, but he was immediately made a member of the starting eleven the following season, at age 17, at right-back, being handed the number 3 shirt, which had previously also belonged to his father, Cesare. Maldini also made his Coppa Italia debut in 1985, on 21 August, while his debut in European competition also came later that same year, on <time datetime="1985-09-18">18, September</time>. He scored the first of his 29 goals in Serie A on 4 January 1987 in a 1&ndash;0 win against Como.</p>

            <h3><b><time datetime="1987">1987</time>&ndash;<time datetime="1991">1991</time>: Domestic and international success with <i>The immortals</i></b></h3>

            <p>The <time datetime="1987">1987</time>&ndash;<time datetime="1988">1988</time> Scudetto under Arrigo Sacchi marked Maldini's first trophy, and the first of seven league titles, with the club. Nicknamed "The Immortals", Sacchi's Milan side is remembered for including the Dutch trio of Frank Rijkaard, Ruud Gullit and Marco van Basten, as well as the Italian midfielders Carlo Ancelotti, Roberto Donadoni (and later Demetrio Albertini), and a strong defensive lineup. Under Sacchi and later Fabio Capello, Maldini formed with long-timers Franco Baresi, Alessandro Costacurta, Mauro Tassotti, as well as Filippo Galli, Stefano Nava and later Christian Panucci, one of football's strongest defensive quartets of all time.During the <time datetime="1987">1987</time>&ndash;<time datetime="1988">1988</time> Serie A season, Milan only conceded 14 goals, finishing with the best defence in Italy, as they went on to win the Serie A title. Maldini went on to win the 1988 Supercoppa Italiana with Milan the following season, and followed up this trophy with back to back European Cup titles in <time datetime="1988">1988</time>&ndash;<time datetime="1989">1989</time> and <time datetime="1989">1989</time>&ndash;<time datetime="1990">1990</time>, while Milan finished in third and in second place in Serie A during those respective seasons. On <time datetime="1989-02-19">19 Febuary, 1989</time>, Maldini made his 100th appearance in Serie A.</p>

            <p>Milan reached the final of the <time datetime="1989">1989</time>&ndash;<time datetime="1990">1990</time> Coppa Italia, losing out to Juventus. Milan also managed to capture successive European Super Cup titles in <time datetime="1989">1989</time> and <time datetime="1990">1990</time>, as well as     successive Intercontinental Cup titles, once again 1989 and 1990. The following season, in Sacchi's final season with the club, Milan were eliminated in the quarter-finals of the European Cup by eventual finalists Marseille, and finished second in Serie A, behind Sampdoria, once again with the best defence in the league, conceding only 19 goals. Milan reached the semi-finals of the Coppa Italia, losing out to eventual champions Roma. In <time datetime="1989">1989</time>, Maldini was awarded the Bravo Award, as the best under-23 player in European Competitions.</p>

            <h3><b><time datetime="1991">1991</time>&ndash;<time datetime="1996">1996</time>: Continued success with <i>The invincibles</i></b></h3>

            <p>Under Sacchi's replacement, Fabio Capello, Milan continued to be a dominant force in Italy and in Europe. Maldini was also part of Milan's undefeated Serie A team, which won the championship in the <time datetime="1991">1991</time>&ndash;<time datetime="1992">1992</time> season; in total, Milan went unbeaten for an Italian record of 58 league matches, earning the nickname "The Invincibles". This championship was Milan's first of three consecutive Serie A titles under Capello in the early <time datetime="1990s">1990s</time>. Maldini helped Milan defend the Serie A title the following season, and reach the first of three consecutive UEFA Champions League finals. Milan lost the <time datetime="1993">1993</time> Champions League final in a 1&ndash;0 defeat to Marseille. That season, Maldini scored his first goal in European Competitions on <time datetime="1992-10-21">october 12th 1992</time> in a 1&ndash;0 Champions League win against Slovan Bratislava, and also made his 200th appearance in Serie A on <time datetime="1992-10-04">october 4th 1992</time> of the same year. The following season, Milan captured their third consecutive Serie A title, finishing with the best defence in Italy, conceding just 15 goals. Maldini also helped lead Milan to a second consecutive Champions League final, where he helped his team defeat Barcelona. Due to Alessandro Costacurta's suspension and injuries sustained to Franco Baresi, Jean-Pierre Papin and Marco van Basten, Barcelona's "Dream Team", coached by Johan Cruyff, were heavy favourites to win the trophy, with the formidable attacking duo of Romário and Hristo Stoichkov. Despite their key absences, Maldini helped the Milan defence keep a clean sheet and overcome Barcelona 4&ndash;0 in the final, with two goals from Daniele Massaro and one each from Dejan Savićević and Marcel Desailly.</p>

            <p>After winning his third Champions League title and reaching the <time datetime="1994">1994</time> World Cup final, Maldini became the first defender ever to win World Soccer magazine's annual World Player of the Year Award. During his acceptance speech, Maldini called his milestone "a particular matter of pride because defenders generally receive so much less attention from fans and the media than goalscorers. We are more in the engine room rather than taking the glory". He then singled out Milan captain Franco Baresi as a player who "really [deserved] to receive the sort of award I have received". Maldini also placed third in the 1994 Ballon d'Or, behind Stoichkov and compatriot Roberto Baggio, and fifth in the FIFA World Player of the Year Award.</p>

            <p>The following season, Milan and Maldini captured their third consecutive Supercoppa Italiana under Capello, and won the European Super Cup, missing out on the Intercontinental Cup. After three consecutive titles, Milan were unable to retain their Serie A title, although they reached their third consecutive Champions League final, where they were defeated 1&ndash;0 by Ajax. Maldini came second behind future teammate George Weah in the <time datetime="1995">1995</time> FIFA World Player of the Year Award for his performances. On <time datetime="1995-02-17">17 Febuary,1995</time>, he made his 300th appearance in Serie A. Maldini was able to capture his fifth Serie A title, and his fourth under Capello, the following season.</p>

            <h3><b><time datetime="1996">1996</time>&ndash;<time datetime="2001">2001</time>: Assuming the captaincy, struggles, and <time datetime="1999">1999</time> Serie A title</b></h3>

            <p>Following Capello's departure, and the aging and retirement of several key players, Milan suffered disappointing results during the next few seasons, undergoing several managerial changes. Milan lost the Supercoppa Italiana to Fiorentina in <time datetime="1996">1996</time>, and failed to qualify for European competitions for two consecutive seasons, as well as suffering a group stage elimination in the <time datetime="1996">1996</time>&ndash;<time datetime="1997">1997</time> Champions League. Following Franco Baresi's and Mauro Tassotti's retirement after the <time datetime="1996">1996</time>&ndash;<time datetime="1997">1997</time> season, Maldini was appointed Milan's captain. Despite the difficulties Milan encountered during this period, through Maldini's leadership, they reached the Coppa Italia final in <time datetime="1998">1998</time>, losing to Lazio, and won the <time datetime="1998">1998</time>&ndash;<time datetime="1999">1999</time> Serie A title under Alberto Zaccheroni, finishing one point ahead of Lazio. He made his 400th Serie A appearance on <time datetime="1999-04-25">25 April 1999</time>. In the <time datetime="1999">1999</time>&ndash;<time datetime="2000">2000</time> season, Milan lost the Supercoppa Italiana against Parma, finished third in Serie A and finished bottom of their Champions League group. Milan were eliminated in the second round of the Champions League the next season and finished in sixth place in Serie A, failing to qualify for the Champions League, and participated in the UEFA Cup the following season.</p>

            <h3><b><time datetime="2001">2001</time>&ndash;<time datetime="2007">2007</time>: New era of success</b></h3>

            <p>Milan again became a dominant force in Italy and in Europe under Carlo Ancelotti. In the <time datetime="2001">2001</time>&ndash;<time datetime="2002">2002</time> season, Milan finished in fourth place, qualifying for the Champions League, and also reached their best ever finish in the UEFA Cup, losing in the semi-finals. In <time datetime="2002">2002</time>, Maldini was awarded the Premio Nazionale Carriera Esemplare "Gaetano Scirea", for his career achievements and personality. The following season, Maldini lined up with Alessandro Nesta, Alessandro Costacurta and Cafu, who, along with Jaap Stam during the <time datetime="2004">2004</time>&ndash;<time datetime="2005">2005</time> season, formed a formidable defensive lineup in Italy and in Europe. Milan finished third in Serie A, but Maldini won the first Coppa Italia of his career, defeating Roma in the final. On <time datetime="2003-03-15">15 March 2003</time>, he made his 500th appearance in Serie A.</p>

            <p>Milan won the <time datetime="2002">2002</time>&ndash;<time datetime="2003">2003</time> Champions League with Maldini as their captain for the first time in his career, in the first all-Italian final, against Juventus, on <time datetime="2003-05-28">28 May 2003</time> at Old Trafford. Maldini helped Milan keep a clean sheet, as they defeated Juventus 3&ndash;2 on penalties after a 0&ndash;0 deadlock following extra time. On that day, it was exactly 40 years since his father, Cesare, had also lifted the European Cup trophy as Milan's captain, also in England. He and his father are only one of three other father-son pairs to have also done so; the others being Manuel and Manolo Sanchís of Real Madrid, and Carles and Sergio Busquets of Barcelona. Maldini was elected Man of the Match and was named in the UEFA Team of the Year for the first time in his career.</p>

            <p>The following season, Milan were defeated by Juventus on penalties in the Supercoppa Italiana, and in the Intercontinental Cup final by Boca Juniors, once again on penalties, but managed to defeat Porto to capture yet another UEFA Super Cup. Maldini placed third in the <time datetime="2003">2003</time> Ballon d'Or for the second time in his career. Maldini went on to captain Milan to win the Serie A title that season, with a record 82 points, whilst Milan were eliminated in the semi-finals of the Coppa Italia by Lazio, and in the quarter-finals of the Champions League by Deportivo de La Coruña. In April <time datetime="2004">2004</time>, Maldini placed tenth on the UEFA Golden Jubilee Poll, an online UEFA survey, which was organised to commemorate the best European footballers of the past 50 years. Maldini was the second-highest placed Italian after Dino Zoff. Maldini was also included in the FIFA 100 list in <time datetime="2004">2004</time>, which was a selection of the 125 greatest living footballers, chosen by Pelé. Following his Series A-winning performances, Maldini was elected to be the Serie A Defender of the Year in <time datetime="2004">2004</time> at the Italian footballing Awards.</p>

            </figure>

            <p>Maldini began the next season by lifting the <time datetime="2004">2004</time> Supercoppa Italiana as captain after Milan defeated Lazio. Milan finished second in Serie A to Juventus that season, and reached the Champions League final, only to lose out on penalties to Liverpool, although Maldini opened the scoring in the first minute. In <time datetime="2005">2005</time>, Maldini was elected to be a part of the UEFA Team of the Year for the second time in his career, and was also elected to be the part of the FIFPro World XI for the first time in his career. The following season, Milan finished second behind Juventus in Serie A once again, and reached the Champions League semi-finals, only to be defeated by eventual champions Barcelona. Both Juventus and Milan were later deducted points for being involved in the <time datetime="2006">2006</time> "Calciopoli" matchfixing scandal, and the title was awarded to Internazionale, while Juventus were relegated, with Milan finishing in third place after the point deduction. During the season, Maldini scored his first and only double of his career, against Reggina. On <time datetime="2005-09-25">25 September 2005</time>, Maldini broke Dino Zoff's Serie A appearance record after playing his 571st league match against Treviso; seven days earlier, he had played his 800th game in all competitions for Milan.</p>

            <p>The following season, Maldini helped to captain Milan to a fourth-place finish, despite their point deduction, leading them to obtain a crucial Champions League qualifying spot. Maldini played his 600th Serie A match on <time datetime="2007-05-13">13 May 2007</time> in a 1&ndash;1 draw at Catania. That season, Maldini captained Milan to their third Champions League final in six years, leading them to a 2&ndash;1 victory over Liverpool in the final on <time datetime="2007-05-23">23 May 2007</time> in Athens, avenging their defeat from <time datetime="2005">2005</time>. At age 38, Maldini became the oldest captain to lift the Champions League trophy. Maldini participated in eight Champions League finals during his career, which is equalled only by Francisco Gento of Real Madrid; Maldini lifted the trophy five times, twice as captain. In an interview with ESPN aired prior to the <time datetime="2007">2007</time> final, Maldini labeled the <time datetime="2005">2005</time> Champions League final as the worst moment of his career. A match where he scored the fastest-ever goal in a European Cup final after 51 seconds and became the oldest player ever to score in a final, Milan lost on penalties to Liverpool after leading 3&ndash;0 at half-time. Maldini was elected the UEFA Club Defender of the Year for his <time datetime="2007">2007</time> performances.</p>

            <p>In <time datetime="2007">2007</time>, after Milan won the UEFA Super Cup against Sevilla (although Maldini did not appear in the match), Maldini became the first European captain to lift the FIFA Club World Cup after defeating Boca Juniors on 16 December. He announced his plans to retire at the end of the <time datetime="2007">2007</time>&ndash;<time datetime="2008">2008</time> season, saying that he would do so with "no regrets". Following Milan's elimination from the Champions League by Arsenal in March, however, Maldini stated that he would possibly delay his retirement for at least a further year. He signed an extension on 6 June that kept him at Milan for the <time datetime="2008">2008</time>&ndash;<time datetime="2009">2009</time> season.</p>

            <h3><b><time datetime="2008">2008</time>&ndash;<time datetime="2009">2009</time>&colon; Final years and retirement</b></h3>

            <p>On <time datetime="2008-02-16">16 febuary 2008</time>, in a match against Parma at the Stadio Ennio Tardini, Maldini came on for defender Marek Jankulovski to make his 1,000th professional career appearance, of which 861 were with Milan, 12 with the Italy under-21 side, 1 with the Italian Olympic team and 126 with the Italy senior team. In European football, only the English goalkeeper Peter Shilton had collected more appearances at the time: 1,390 between <time datetime="1966">1966</time> and <time datetime="1997">1997</time>. Maldini played his last game in the Champions League on <time datetime="2008-03-04">4 March 2008</time>, a 2&ndash;0 loss at the San Siro in the last 16 against Arsenal which eliminated Milan from the <time datetime="2007">2007</time>&ndash;<time datetime="2008">2008</time> Champions League. In <time datetime="2008">2008</time>, Maldini was awarded the FIFA Order of Merit, as well as the Premio Internazionale Giacinto Facchetti, which is awarded to a player who was demonstrated both skill and fair play throughout his career.</p>

            <p>On <time datetime="2009-04-18">18 April 2008</time>, Maldini announced that he would retire at the end of the <time datetime="2008">2008</time>&ndash;<time datetime="2009">2009</time> season. On <time datetime="2009-05-17">17 May 2009</time>, in the Stadio Friuli, Maldini played his 900th official match for Milan in a league game against Udinese. Maldini's last match in San Siro was on <time datetime="2009=05-24">24 May</time>, a 3&ndash;2 loss against Roma, and was given a standing ovation by the fans. There was a small controversy, however, when the Milan Ultras fans known as Brigate Rossonere protested against Maldini as he said goodbye. His last appearance for Milan, and his last game as an active player, was a 2&ndash;0 win against Fiorentina on <time datetime="2009-05-31">31 May 2009</time> in the last match of the Serie A season. This win meant Milan finished in third place and qualified for the following season's Champions League. Maldini was once again given a standing ovation by the fans. As they had previously done with Franco Baresi's number 6 shirt, Milan retired Maldini's number 3 shirt, but stated that it will be bequeathed to one of his sons if one of them were to make the club's senior team.</p>

            <p>On <time datetime="2009-08-28">28 August 2009</time> in Monte Carlo, Maldini was awarded a prize for his career by UEFA during the draw for the group stage of the <time datetime="2009">2009</time>&ndash;<time datetime="2010">2010</time> Champions League. On <time datetime="2009-11-17">17 November 2009</time>, Spanish sports newspaper Marca awarded Maldini the "Marca Leyenda" prize for his career and achievements.</p>

            <p>In <time datetime="1986">1986</time>, Maldini was called up by his father Cesare Maldini to the Italian under-21 national team, and made his debut for the team on <time datetime="1986-11-26">26 November</time> of that year, in a 0&ndash;0 draw against Austria; he earned 12 caps and scored five goals in two years with the azzurrini, with his first goal coming on <time datetime="1987-02-11">11 febuary 1987</time>, in a 2&ndash;1 win against Portugal. Maldini was also member of the under-21 team that finished runners-up to Spain in the <time datetime="1986">1986</time> UEFA European Under-21 Championship. Two years later, he also featured for the under-21 team that was eliminated in the first round against eventual winners France in the <time datetime="1988">1988</time> UEFA European Under-21 Championship.</p>

            <p>Maldini made his senior debut for the Italy senior team at age 19 on <time datetime="1988-03-31">31 March 1988</time> in a 1&ndash;1 friendly draw against Yugoslavia in Split,[67] and made one appearance for the Italy Olympic squad on <time datetime="1987-10-28">28 October 1987</time>, although he was not part of the team that finished in fourth place at the <time datetime="1988">1988</time> Olympics. Maldini featured in all four of Italy's games at UEFA Euro<time datetime="1988">1988</time> 1988, where they reached the semi-finals, losing to the Soviet Union.</p>

            <p>Maldini participated in his first World Cup in <time datetime="1990">1990</time> on home soil, appearing in all seven Italy matches. He helped Italy to win five consecutive games and was a starting member of the defence that kept a FIFA World Cup record of five consecutive clean sheets. The Italian defence eventually conceded an equalising goal in the semi-final match against Carlos Bilardo's Argentina, after going a World Cup record total of 518 minutes without conceding. Following two periods of extra time, in which neither team was able to score, Italy lost out to Argentina on penalties. Italy eventually placed third after defeating England 2&ndash;1 in the third-place final match, and finishing the tournament with the best defence having conceded two goals throughout the entire World Cup. Maldini was elected to be part of the Team of the Tournament.</p>

            <h3><b><time datetime="1994">1994</time> World Cup Final and appointment to captaincy</b></h3>

            <p>Maldini's first international goal came in his 44th career match, in a 2&ndash;0 friendly win over Mexico in Florence on <time datetime="1993-01-20">20 january 1993</time>. Maldini was part of the Italy squad that participated in the <time datetime="1992">1992</time> U.S. Cup, finishing in second place in the friendly tournament, behind the host nation. Italy failed to qualify for Euro <time datetime="1992">1992</time>, finishing second in their group, but qualified for the <time datetime="1994">1994</time> World Cup, where Maldini was named vice-captain for Italy. During the <time datetime="1994">1994</time> World Cup, Maldini played in all seven of Italy's matches, and deputised for the injured Franco Baresi in the matches against Mexico, Nigeria, Spain and Bulgaria, keeping a clean sheet in the group match against Norway. Maldini led the Italian defence to the final, playing both as a centre-back and as a full-back, due to the absences of his Milan and Italy defensive teammates Baresi, due to injury, Mauro Tassotti, due to suspension after the quarter-finals, and Alessandro Costacurta, who was suspended for the final. Maldini helped Italy keep a clean sheet in the final against favourites Brazil as the team eventually lost on penalties. As in <time datetime="1990">1990</time>, Maldini was named in the Team of the Tournament, 32 years after his father Cesare received the same honour at the <time datetime="1962">1962</time> World Cup.</p>

            <p>After Franco Baresi's international retirement in <time datetime="1994">1994</time>, Maldini was appointed the team's full-time captain. A disappointing Euro <time datetime="1996">1996</time> campaign saw Italy eliminated in the group stage with four points, in a group which contained the two eventual finalists of the tournament, Germany and the Czech Republic. Maldini played in all three of Italy's group matches. The <time datetime="1998">1998</time> World Cup in France saw Italy start strongly, topping their group. Maldini played in all five of Italy's matches, and started the play that led to Christian Vieri's opening goal in Italy's first match against Chile, which ended in a 2&ndash;2 draw. Maldini, partnering with Alessandro Costacurta, Fabio Cannavaro, Alessandro Nesta and Giuseppe Bergomi, also helped Italy to keep clean sheets in the second group match against Cameroon, the round of 16 match Norway and France in the quarter-finals, but Italy eventually went out of the tournament to the hosts and eventual champions on penalties, for the third consecutive time in a World Cup.</p>

            <h3><b>Euro<time datetime="2000">2000</time> Final and fourth World Cup</b></h3>

            <p>Maldini made his 100th appearance for Italy on <time datetime="1999-04-28">28 April 1998</time>, in a 0&ndash;0 friendly away draw against Croatia, under manager Dino Zoff. The following year, Italy reached the final of Euro <time datetime="2000">2000</time>, but lost once again to defending World Cup champions France in extra time. Maldini played in all six of Italy's matches during the tournament. Italy topped their group, winning every match, and Maldini, starting alongside Fabio Cannavaro and Alessandro Nesta, helped the Italian defence to concede only two goals en route to the final, keeping clean sheets against co-hosts Belgium in the group stage, Romania in the quarter-finals and co-hosts the Netherlands in the semi-finals. A ten-man Italy advanced to the final on penalties after a 0&ndash;0 draw with the Dutch following extra time. Although Maldini missed his penalty, Italy won the shootout 3&ndash;1. Italy were leading 1&ndash;0 in the final until Wiltord equalised in the final minute of stoppage time. David Trezeguet scored the golden goal in the 103rd minute, in extra time. In all of the three UEFA European Championships in which Maldini participated, he was elected to be part of the team of the tournament for his performances.</p>

            <p>On <time datetime="2000-10-07">7 October 2000</time>, in a 3&ndash;0 win over Romania in Milan in a <time datetime="2002">2002</time> World Cup qualifier, Maldini overtook Dino Zoff to become Italy's most capped player of all time with his 113th senior international appearance for Italy. Maldini played in his fourth World Cup, and his second as captain, in the <time datetime="2002">2002</time> World Cup in Korea and Japan. He helped Italy keep a clean sheet in their opening win against Ecuador, and played in all four of Italy's matches. Italy disappointed in the remaining group matches, but went on to the knockout round as the second placed team of their group. Immediately after a ten-man Italy were controversially eliminated in the round of sixteen, by a golden goal, to co-hosts South Korea, Maldini retired from international football, at the age of 34, as Italy's most capped player. He scored seven international goals, all coming in home games. He spent over half of his 16 years as an international as team captain, wearing the armband a record 74 times, until he was overtaken by Cannavaro, and subsequently Buffon. Despite his performances for his country, Maldini was unable to win a trophy, although he reached the final of both the World Cup and the European Championship. Maldini made 23 appearances in World Cups, the third-highest total after Lothar Matthäus, who appeared in 25 matches and Lionel Messi, who appeared in 26 matches.</p>

            <p>In <time datetime="2009-02">febuary 2009</time>, Italian head coach Marcello Lippi declared his support for a testimonial match for Maldini, stating that it would give him a chance to play for the Azzurri for a final time. The Italian Football Federation (FIGC) offered him a place in the line-up in a friendly match against Northern Ireland. Maldini, however, rejected the offer, saying that he wanted to part with football in an "official" match.</p>
