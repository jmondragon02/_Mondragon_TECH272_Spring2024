<h1>Joshua Mondragon</h1>
<p>I was born in Takoma Park, MD and have lived in Montgomery County my whole life. I have always been interested with making and building things with my hands since I was a kid, so its no suprise when I got older I was interested in the world of technology and computers.</p>
<p>I am now 21 years old, attending MC and <strong>in Computer simulation and gaming.</strong> I chose to pick CSG for my majorr because video games have been a big part of my life growing up and even now. I also enjoy sports mainly soccer, the team I support is AC Milan from Italy. I also enjoy watching movies and TV shows, with Back to the future being my favorite movie watching it over 10 times, and an anime called Attack on Titan being my favorite show</p>
<p></p> I want in 10 years <em>is to be happy</em> with where I am in life with no regrets and to just honestly be successful with whatever path I chose, because nobody knows I may have a different career other that CSG.</p>
